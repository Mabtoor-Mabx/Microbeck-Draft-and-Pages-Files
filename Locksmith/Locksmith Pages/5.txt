The {craft|profession|occupation} of locksmithing includes creating or fixing locks. Before {opening|starting} their own {company|firm|business|corporation|organization}, locksmiths {frequently|often|repeatedly|commonly|again and again} need to complete a few classes, {collect|accumulate|pick up|gather|obtain} job experience, and {collect|accumulate|pick up|gather|obtain} certification. {cptags|cptags} {optags|optags} Any {service-based|service-minded} {company|firm|business|corporation|organization} can follow {standard|normal|conventional} {company|firm|business|corporation|organization} practices, but the locksmith {industry|business|trade|enterprise} is {particularly|especially|specially|specifically} {important|significant|crucial|essential|vital} because it is {typically|usually|generally|commonly} an owner-operated {company|firm|business|corporation|organization}.
